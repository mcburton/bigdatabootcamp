Things i want to cover
- a little bit about me and my background
- a brief history of the IPython project
- the distinctions b/w IPython, IPython Notebook, and other infrastructural features
- focus in on the IPython Notebook
- At a basic level the Notebook is a command line interpreter (REPL)
- except in a web browser (and thus inherits the expressive capabilities of HTML)
- except it is document (session?) centric
- the webbyness and documentyness afford rich computational interactions, or "computeryness"
- the affordances of the IPython Notebook
- The atomic computational unit is a "cell"
- Cells can have different types
- code cells
- raw text cells
- heading cells (1 - 6)
- markdown cells
- You arrange cells in a linear order to compose notebooks (document)
- Cells are *executable* (and I'm going to introduce them from least to most complex)
- When you execute a raw text cell, nothing really happens. The text you typed into the text field is rendered as plain text (with all the formatting you'd expect)
- When you execute a heading cell it renders the content as an HTML header element `<h1>,<h2>,<h3>`
- So don't dump a whole bunch of text in a Heading 1 cell otherwise it will be rendered all big 
- Markdown cells, who here knows of markdown?
- markdown is a formatting convention for plain text that allows you to write HTML without all the ugly angle brackets
- So when you execute a markdown cell the plain text contents is transformed into HTML
- Markdown has conventions for headings, links, images, bold and italic text, quotes, lists, code blocks. It isn't meant for authoring everything in HTML.
- you *might* wonder, why have special heading cells beyond markdown cells (which support headings)
- heading cells (vs. doing headers in markdown cells) allow you to but semantically meaningful sections, with anchor tags, into your document.
- OK, so now on to the really fun stuff, code cells
- code cells are miniture python text editor
- highlighting, code completion, object & function introspection & documentation
- when you "run" a cell, the code is executed in a python kernel running in the background.
- each notebook has its own kernel thread where variables, data, libraries, etc are in memory 
- the output (if there is any) is displayed directly below the cell
- IPython moves beyond text & supports, HTML, JSON, PNG, JPEG, SVG, LaTeX
- go through exampes from [rich display system notebook example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Part%205%20-%20Rich%20Display%20System.ipynb) 
- Images - embedded vs. linked (will discuss when talking about the Notebook document format)
- audio
- video & youtube
- LaTeX - not full power of LaTeX, but supports formula using the MathJax javascript library
- HTML
- using the __repr__ method python objects can define how they should be represented as text
- Pandas DataFrame 
- wait, what was that %%file thing I did? IPython Magics!
- IPython Notebooks are also a JSON document format
- easy to git & easy to share
- NBConvert lets you transform Notebooks into LaTeX, HTML...even Reveal.js slides!
